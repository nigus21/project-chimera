## What the Chart Reveals

The chart shows a **consistent discrepancy** between Finance and Delivery totals across all three months:

- **Finance consistently reports higher totals** than Delivery in every month
- The gap ranges from **$3,300 to $6,300** per month (2.8% to 5.1% difference)
- While the **absolute gap narrowed** from November ($6,300) to January ($3,300), the pattern persists
- Both systems show similar **trend patterns** (peak in December, decline in January), suggesting they're tracking related but not identical transactions

The visual separation between the two lines makes it immediately clear that these systems are not aligned, which could lead to reporting inconsistencies and decision-making challenges.

## Potential Causes

The discrepancies likely stem from one or more of these common issues:

1. **Different recording dates**: Finance may record transactions on order/invoice dates, while Delivery uses shipment/completion dates. Month-end transactions can appear in different months across systems.

2. **Different inclusion criteria**: Finance may include cancelled orders, refunds, or adjustments that Delivery excludes, or vice versa. Each system may have different rules for what "counts" as a completed transaction.

3. **Manual processing delays**: If either system relies on manual data entry or batch processing, temporary gaps can persist and accumulate over time.

4. **Different calculation methods**: Finance totals might include taxes, fees, or discounts that Delivery excludes, or use different bases (gross vs. net of returns).

## Why Early Resolution Matters

Addressing these discrepancies now is important for several business reasons:

- **Accurate reporting**: Leadership needs reliable, consistent numbers to make informed decisions. Conflicting data from Finance and Delivery creates confusion and reduces confidence in reporting.

- **Better planning**: Budgets, forecasts, and operational targets depend on accurate historical data. Misaligned systems can lead to unrealistic expectations or missed opportunities.

- **Operational efficiency**: When Finance and Delivery don't match, teams spend time investigating discrepancies instead of focusing on core business activities. Early resolution prevents this recurring overhead.

- **Stakeholder trust**: Consistent discrepancies can erode trust in both systems and the data used for performance evaluations, bonuses, and strategic planning.

- **Cost control**: Understanding the true gap helps identify whether there are unaccounted transactions, processing errors, or systemic issues that could impact financial health.

## Next Steps

We recommend:
1. **Immediate reconciliation** of at least one month's data to identify root causes
2. **Establishing a single source of truth** for reporting purposes
3. **Implementing monthly variance checks** with a defined threshold (e.g., 1-2%) to catch issues early

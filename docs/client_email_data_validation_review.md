# Data Validation Review — Client Email (Concise)

**Subject:** Data validation review summary and recommended next steps

---

Dear [Client Name],

We’ve completed our data validation review comparing your Finance and Delivery systems over the last three months. We know misalignments can be frustrating, so we’ve summarized what we found and three clear paths forward.

**What we found**

Finance and Delivery do not fully align. Value gaps are **$3,300–$6,300 per month** (**2.8%–5.1%**), with Finance higher each month. Record counts differ by **26–60 per month** (**2.2%–4.8%**). The gap is largest in November and narrows by January but remains consistent enough to affect reporting and planning.

**Why this is happening**

Likely causes: different recording dates (order vs. delivery), different rules for what counts as a completed transaction, manual or delayed updates, or different definitions of “total” (e.g. taxes/fees in one system only). This is common when two systems serve different teams—not a sign of carelessness.

**Visual summary**

A line chart (Finance vs. Delivery totals by month) shows both series moving in parallel with a clear, consistent gap—useful for sharing with stakeholders and making the case to align the systems.

**Paths forward**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A. Quick fix** | Choose one system as the single source of truth and report from it only. | Fast, no process change. | Doesn’t fix root causes; the other system stays out of sync. |
| **B. Full reconciliation** | Match records between systems for at least one month, document causes, then define ongoing rules. | Addresses causes; builds a clear, defensible story. | Requires time and cross-team coordination. |
| **C. Monitor only** | Set a monthly check (e.g. total value and record count) and investigate when the gap exceeds a threshold (e.g. 2%). | Low effort; catches new issues. | Doesn’t explain or reduce the current gap. |

**Our recommendation**

We recommend **Option B (full reconciliation)**. It’s the only path that explains the gaps, builds trust in the numbers, and reduces repeated fire drills. We can scope it to one month and one working session to keep the lift manageable.

Happy to discuss timing, resourcing, or to walk through the chart and options on a short call.

Best regards,
